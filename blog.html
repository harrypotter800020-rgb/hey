                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM)</strong> – A large meta-analysis confirms that CGM use reduces HbA1c by an average of 0.8% in type 2 diabetes patients not on insulin.</li>
                    <li><strong>SGLT2 Inhibitors</strong> – New real-world data shows SGLT2 inhibitors lower cardiovascular death risk by 23% in diabetic patients with heart failure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plant‑Based Diets</strong> – A 12-week RCT found that a low-fat vegan diet improved insulin sensitivity and promoted weight loss compared to a conventional diabetic diet.</li>

                content: `<p><strong>Myth 1: Vaccines cause autism.</strong> This myth originated from a fraudulent 1998 study that has been retracted. Dozens of large-scale studies involving millions of children have found no link.</p>
                <p><strong>Myth 2: Natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity.</strong> While natural infection can produce strong immunity, it comes at the risk of severe illness, hospitalisation, or death. Vaccines provide protection without the dangers.</p>
                <p><strong>Myth 3: Vaccines contain harmful toxins.</strong> Vaccine ingredients (like aluminium salts) are used in minute amounts and have been rigorously tested for safety. The amount of aluminium in vaccines is far less than what is present in breast milk or infant formula.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Can eating eggs raise cholesterol?</strong> For most people, dietary cholesterol has a small impact – saturated and trans fats are bigger culprits.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stimulates insulin secretion when blood sugar is high.</li>
                    <li>Slows gastric emptying (food stays in stomach longer → feeling full).</li>
                    <li>Acts on brain receptors to reduce appetite.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Approved doses for weight loss (e.g., Wegovy 2.4 mg) are higher than those for diabetes, and studies show average weight loss of 15%.</p>`

                <p><strong>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)</strong> – 15%, more aggressive, strongly linked to smoking, usually metastasised by diagnosis. Primary treatment is chemotherapy + radiation.</p>
                <p>Biomarker testing (EGFR, ALK, PD‑L1) is crucial for NSCLC; SCLC is increasingly studied for DLL3 targeted agents.</p>`

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Protein at every meal</strong> – Helps repair tissues. Eggs, Greek yoghurt, lentils, tofu.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong> – Soups, smoothies, and infused water can be easier than plain water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don’t fear soy</strong> – Current evidence shows moderate soy consumption is safe for breast cancer survivors.”</li>
